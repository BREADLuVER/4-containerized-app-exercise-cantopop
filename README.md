![Python build & test](https://github.com/software-students-fall2023/4-containerized-app-exercise-cantopop/actions/workflows/containerized-app.yml/badge.svg) 


## Description

When taking notes in class, it can be stressful to try to jot down everything one sees on the slides the professor is presenting. This handy web app allows students to snap a quick picture of a slide that may be too much to write down manually, and the app will automatically convert the text in the image to a text note that can be later referenced.
